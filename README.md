# Multiplayer Mine Sweeper

This repo contains a frontend and backend for a multiplayer game created for one of the project weeks at Codaisseur Academy. It uses Typescript, Koa, routing-controllers and TypeORM in the backend and React/Redux with Material UI in the frontend. The backend exposes a REST API but also sends messages over websockets using SocketIO.
